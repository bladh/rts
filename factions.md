# Factions in 'unnamed scifi rts'

## Imperial mining company

The "standard" faction with the least surprises. IMC relies more on
fortifying positions and have excellent scouting options but also heavy
weaponry. Due to lacking mobile generators they're very reliant on supply
lines for their armies and artilleries.

#### Units

* Infantry
* Worker (light construction vehicle, needs better name)
* Light Tank
* Heavy Tank
* Helicopter
* Mobile Battery
* Armored Hauler

#### Structures

* Power Generator
* Depot (contains resources. armored)
* Barracks
* Factory
* Battery
* Turret
* Artillery
* Armored Gate (fortified underground opening)

## Pirate miners

Similarly has a mining station like the IMC. The IMC has a gritty, grungy
used look, and the Pirates are predictably even more ragged.
Their only tank is slightly sturdier than the IMC light tank, but will not
compete well against heavy tanks.

They don't have helicopters, but can build slow moving balloons that have
very excellent vision, and which can't be targeted by ground units.

They have limited construction options and rely more on capturing structures
from others.

Their excavation options are limited and they can't dig tunnels underground.


#### Units

* Infantry
* Worker (infantry version of imc worker)
* Sniper (slow, sneaky pricy unit. multiple snipers dramatically increase
their visibility modifier.)
* Renegade Tank
* Recon Balloon
* Truck (hauling unit, faster than IMC counterpart)
* Mobile Generator (slow, high vis)

#### Structures

* Power Generator
* Bunker (low visibility modifier unless shooting)
* Cache (contains resources, low visibility modifier)
* Improvised mine (Only visible for infantry)

## Skryj

Indigineous alien life form.
Skryj does not need resources.
Instead of a mining station like the other races, Skryj has an underground
Queens Den. The Queen can be upgraded with biomass, generated by some
structures.

#### Units

Skryj does not have ranged combat units. Skryj move underground very easily
so their structures tend to be there. Their units are generally low vis.
No air units.

* Drone (Capture enemy infantry to bring home)

Drones can also enter a human building to abduct civilians from them.
Drones have bad sight, but their antennae lets them detect enemy movement from
quite far away.

* Gore Worm (Moves underground without tunnels. Can sense units and structures
above it). Will "infect" infantry units, converting them to Skryj.
* Dusk Crab (lumbering high armor unit that deals a lot of damage to structures
and vehicles). Can use destroyed vehicles or structures as armor, but the
best armor is an unpowered vehicle.

#### Structures

Structures must be placed adjacent to another structure.

* Melting pool (Place captured/infected infantry here to create biomass)
